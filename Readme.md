### Submission Rules

1. **Relevance**: Ensure your prompt is relevant to one of our existing categories or propose a new category.
2. **Clarity**: Clearly define the purpose and expected outcome of the prompt.
3. **Format**: Use the format provided in the form to ensure consistency. Always use `${variable:type}` to define variables in a prompt.
4. **Originality**: Your prompt should be original and not infringe on any third-party rights.
5. **Tone**: Maintain a professional and helpful tone in your prompt.

#### Variable Types

- **Text Input**: Use `input` for single-line text inputs (e.g., `${name:input}`, `${subject:input}`).
- **Multi-line Text**: Use `textarea` for longer text or multi-line input (e.g., `${description:textarea}`, `${body:textarea}`).
- **Boolean**: Use `bool` for yes/no, true/false inputs (e.g., `${confirmation:bool}`, `${call_to_action:bool}`).
- **Choice List**: Use predefined options in square brackets for choices (e.g., `${tone:[formal, casual, professional]}`).

#### Example Prompts

- **Text Input**: `${userName:input}` – expects a single line of text (e.g., "JohnDoe").
- **Multi-line Text**: `${feedback:textarea}` – expects a longer, multi-line description (e.g., "I really enjoyed the feature...").
- **Boolean**: `${isApproved:bool}` – expects a true/false answer (e.g., true or false).
- **Choice**: `${priority:[low, medium, high]}` – expects one of the predefined options.
